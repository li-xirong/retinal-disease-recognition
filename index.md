## Project Overview

Welcome to the homepage of the Multi-Modal AI for Retinal Disease Recognition (MM-AI-RDR) project! The MM-AI-RDR project is setup to attack an emerging challenge of multi-modal retinal disease recognition. Given a multi-modal case consisting of a color fundus photo (CFP) and an array of OCT B-scan images acquired during an eye examination, we aim to build a deep neural network that recognizes multiple vision-threatening diseases for the given case. As the efficacy of CFP and OCT is disease-dependent, the networkâ€™s ability of being both selective and interpretable is important.
